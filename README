NOTE: The code in here in coffeescript was not written by me, I took a badly hacked together example from d3's site that a friend was trying to fix up and converted it to coffeescript with an example of how I usually organize my javascript, the logic and functions are still pretty bad though.

Begginings of a simple asset pipeline script for who enjoy:
  * Seperation of code into files based on function, area, or "class"
  * The benefits of coffee script
  * The benefits of 

And those who do not want to rely on:
  * Node.js
  * Rails
  * Pylon
  * Django
  * etc
  * . . .

Do enjoy such things :)

Right now it has very basic functionality, plan to add sass support in the future, maybe haml but thats another beast for planning how to integrate them.
