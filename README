Dependencies:
  * Coffeescript-Python - http://github.com/doloopwhile/Python-CoffeeScript
    $ pip install coffeescript
  * Slimit python native javascript minifier - http://github.com/rspivak/slimit/
    $ pip install slimit
    
Deep Dependencies (should be resolved by pip):
  * PyExecJS - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyExecJS
    $ pip install PyExecJS
  * PyV8 - http://code.google.com/p/pyv8/
    $ pip install PyV8

How to Build:
  cd into main directory and type make, this will place a debug version in debug and a release version in release or warn you of any compile errors, look at example for suggested foldier hierarchy.
  
NOTE: The code in here in coffeescript was not written by me, I modified the sunburst example from https://github.com/mbostock/d3 however I didn't get into modifying any of the structure just converted it over.

Begginings of a simple asset pipeline script for who enjoy:
  * Seperation of code into files based on function, area, or "class"
  * The benefits of coffee script
  * The benefits of 

And those who do not want to rely on:
  * Node.js
  * Rails
  * Pylon
  * Django
  * etc
  * . . .

Do enjoy such things :)

Right now it has very basic functionality, plan to add sass support in the future, maybe haml but thats another beast for planning how to integrate them. This example is flush with 1000 foldiers for something fairly simple those could definitely be reduced.
